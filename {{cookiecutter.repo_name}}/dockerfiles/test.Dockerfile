# This Dockerfile has a default BASE_IMAGE, but you can override it with --build-arg.

# To be used in the FROM, naturally an ARG must come before the FROM.
# However, any *other* ARG above the FROM will be silently ignored.
# So it's very important that the ARGs are below the FROM.

# If we ran before_script in a separate RUN before the COPY of the code,
# then that layer could stay cached when the repo contents changed,
# but it's more valuable to keep all the environment variables confined to a single RUN.
# before_script.sh shouldn't take long to run anyway.

# The before_script.sh script sets several environment variables.
# Environment variables do *not* persist across Docker RUN lines.
# See also https://vsupalov.com/set-dynamic-environment-variable-during-docker-image-build/
# This allows Docker images to be portable to other networks if necessary.

# Ideally we want assembler.py to insert appropriate EXPOSE instructions for any ports,
# such as port 8888 for Jupyter or port 8050 for Plotly Dash.
# However, unless you're having containers talk to other containers,
# EXPOSE does not technically do anything you care about;
# docker run --publish does all the heavy lifting.
